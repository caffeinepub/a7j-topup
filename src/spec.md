# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the A7J TOPUP frontend UI to a clean, professional white + purple theme (#6C5CE7), removing any dark/gaming/gradient-heavy styling while keeping all existing backend behavior unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply a site-wide visual refresh: pure white primary backgrounds, purple (#6C5CE7) accents, clean sans-serif typography, consistent spacing/sizing, rounded corners, and soft shadows; remove heavy gradients and neon/glow effects.
- Redesign the header/navigation: logo on the left, nav links (Home, Add Money, Buy Points, Topup Diamonds, Earn Points), wallet balance display for authenticated users, and a responsive mobile menu.
- Redesign the Home hero section to be minimal: white background, bold headline, small subtitle, and a single primary “Add Money” CTA that routes to the Add Money flow.
- Update cards/sections across landing and core pages to use white/light-gray palette with rounded corners and soft shadows (no gradient card backgrounds) while maintaining responsive layouts.
- Redesign the footer to a light gray background with clear sections for contact info, social links, and terms; ensure responsive layout and English text.

**User-visible outcome:** The site presents a consistent clean white-and-purple professional UI on mobile and desktop, with an updated responsive header (including wallet balance), a minimal Home hero with an “Add Money” CTA, refreshed card/section styling, and a light professional footer.
