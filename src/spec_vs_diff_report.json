  "summary": "Most of the requested white/purple professional redesign appears implemented in global CSS theme tokens, header nav structure (including specified links + wallet balance), Home hero layout/CTA, updated card styling, and a light-gray footer with contact/social/legal sections. However, the Home hero copy still references “gaming top-ups,” and the diff summary indicates additional auth/routing/admin/business-logic related work and even a gradient button that were not requested in this UI-only redesign.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Hero copy is in English and avoids gaming-arena tone (no \"Gaming Top-Up\" style messaging).",
      "reason": "The Home hero subtitle explicitly mentions “gaming top-ups,” which conflicts with the acceptance criteria to avoid gaming-arena/gaming-topup tone.",
